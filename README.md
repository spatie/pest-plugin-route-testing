# Make sure all routes in your Laravel app are ok

In a typical Laravel application there are many pages that can be accessed by users. It's easy to forget to test all of them. This package makes it easy to test all GET routes in your application.

Here's a quick example:

```php
use function Spatie\RouteTesting\routeTesting;

routeTesting('all GET routes')
   ->assertSuccessful();
```

This will test all GET routes in your application and ensure they return a 200 HTTP status code. Here's what the output looks like when you run this test in a small app.

Instead of `assertSuccessful()` you can use any assertion that is available in Laravel's `TestResponse` class, such as `assertRedirect()`, `assertNotFound()`, `assertForbidden()`, etc.

You can also test specific routes:

```php
use function Spatie\RouteTesting\routeTesting;

routeTesting('all blog routes')
    ->include('blog*')
    ->assertSuccessful();
```

If you there are routes that have route model bindings, the package will skip the test for those routes. Let's assume you have a route defined as  `user/{user}`. Here's what the output looks like when you run the test.

If you want to test a route with a route model binding, you can provide the model using the `bind` method.

```php
use function Spatie\RouteTesting\routeTesting;
use App\Models\User;

routeTesting('all blog routes')
    ->bind('user', User::factory()->create())
    ->assertSuccessful();
```

When you run the test now, the package will use the provided model to test the route.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require spatie/pest-plugin-route-testing --dev
```

## Usage

You can use the `routeTesting` function to test all routes in your application.

```php
use function Spatie\RouteTesting\routeTesting;

routeTesting('all routes')
    ->assertSuccessful();
```

This will test all GET routes in your application and ensure they return a 200 HTTP status code. Here's what the output looks like when you run this test in a small app.

Instead of `assertSuccessful()` you can use any assertion that is available in Laravel's `TestResponse` class, such as `assertRedirect()`, `assertNotFound()`, `assertForbidden()`, etc.

Here's an example where we test if a redirect is working.

```php
use function Spatie\RouteTesting\routeTesting;

routeTesting('redirect')
    ->include('old-section/*')
    ->assertRedirect('new-section/*');
```

### Testing specific routes

You can test specific routes by using the `include` method. There is support for wildcards. Here's an example that tests all routes that start with `blog`.

```php
use function Spatie\RouteTesting\routeTesting;

routeTesting('all blog routes')
    ->include('blog*')
    ->assertSuccessful();
```

You can also pass as many arguments as you want to the `include` method.

```php
use function Spatie\RouteTesting\routeTesting;

routeTesting('all blog routes')
    ->include('blog*', 'post*')
    ->assertSuccessful();
```

### Excluding routes

If you want to exclude routes from the test, you can use the `exclude` method. Here's an example that tests all routes except the ones that start with `admin`.

```php
use function Spatie\RouteTesting\routeTesting;

routeTesting('all blog routes')
    ->exclude('admin*')
    ->assertSuccessful();
```

### Binding route model bindings

If you there are routes that have route model bindings, the package will skip the test for those routes. Let's assume you have a route defined as  `user/{user}`. Here's what the output looks like when you run the test.

If you want to test a route with a route model binding, you can provide the model using the `bind` method.

```php
use function Spatie\RouteTesting\routeTesting;
use App\Models\User;

routeTesting('all blog routes')
    ->bind('user', User::factory()->create())
    ->assertSuccessful();
```

When you run the test now, the package will use the provided model to test the route.

If you don't want to display tests that are skipped because of a missing model binding, you can call `ignoreRoutesWithMissingBindings()`.

```php
use function Spatie\RouteTesting\routeTesting;

routeTesting('all blog routes')
    ->ignoreRoutesWithMissingBindings()
    ->assertSuccessful();
```

### Executing custom code before the test

You can use the `setUp` method to execute code before the route test is run. Here's an example where we log in a user before running the test.

```php
use function Spatie\RouteTesting\routeTesting;

routeTesting('all admin routes')
    ->setUp(function ()
    {
        $user = User::factory()->create();
        
        $this->actingAs($user);
        
        // optionally, you could also bind the model
        $this->bind('user', $user);
    })
    ->include('admin*')
    ->assertSuccessful();
```
